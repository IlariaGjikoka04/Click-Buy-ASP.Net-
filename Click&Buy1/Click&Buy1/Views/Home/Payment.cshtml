        <h5 class="fw-bold">2. WHEN IS THE PURCHASE AMOUNT REMOVED FROM MY BANK ACCOUNT?</h5>
        <p>
            Once the bank authorizes payment, you will receive an email confirmation of the order, but the money will not be removed from your account until the items leave our warehouse to the destination you requested.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that if, for any reason, we cannot send any of the items you ordered, there will be no charge to your account for that amount.
